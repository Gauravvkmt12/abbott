                We may use the personal information we collect about you with information obtained from other sources, such as public databases, social media platforms and other third parties.

                <p class="mt-4 mb-4">In addition, some of our applications and mobile-optimized sites may have location-based features. To deliver these features, we may collect and use location data provided by your mobile device. For example, we may offer shopping features that allow you to get information about local merchants. By using such applications, you consent to the collection and use of your mobile device location data for purposes of delivering these location-based features.</p>
                <p class="mt-4 mb-4">We may use personal information collected from any of the sources listed in the “How Does Abbott Collect Personal Information?” section of this policy for our internal business purposes, such as data analysis, audits, developing new products, enhancing our websites and apps, improving our Abbott Services, identifying usage trends and determining the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns.</p>

                    <p class="mt-4 mb-4">We do not sell your personal information.

                    <p class="mt-4 mb-4">Some Service Providers may collect personal data on behalf of Abbott. These third parties may be provided with access to personal data needed to perform their functions. In addition, Abbott’s practice is to require its Service Providers to keep your personal information confidential and to use personal information only to perform functions for Abbott.</p>
                    <p class="mt-4 mb-4">If Abbott sells all or part of one of its product lines or divisions, your information may be transferred to the buyer. Abbott reserves the right to disclose your information to respond to authorized information requests from government authorities, to respond to valid judicial requests, to address national security situations, to provide security and investigate potential fraud, or when otherwise required by applicable law.</p>
                    <p class="mt-4 mb-4">Abbott may also disclose your personal information as required by law to any competent law enforcement body, regulatory or government agency, court or other third party where we believe the disclosure is necessary or appropriate to comply with a regulatory requirement, judicial proceeding, court order, government request or legal process served on us, or to protect the safety, rights, or property of our customers, the public, Abbott or others, and to exercise, establish or defend Abbott’s legal rights.</p>
                    <p class="mt-4 mb-4">Abbott may also disclose aggregate or de-identified data that is not personally identifiable to third parties for any purpose.</p>
                    <h5>COOKIES AND OTHER TOOLS</h5>
                    <p class="mt-4 mb-4">Abbott and its Service Providers collect information about you by using cookies, tracking pixels, web beacons and other technologies (collectively, “Tools”). We use this information to better understand, customize and improve user experience with our websites, services and offerings as well as to manage our advertising. This information can make your use of our Abbott Services easier and more meaningful by allowing Abbott and our Service Providers to provide better service, customize sites based on consumer preferences, compile statistics, provide you with more relevant advertisements based on your interests, analyze trends and otherwise administer and improve our Abbott Services. If we have collected your personal information, we may associate this personal data with information gathered through the Tools.</p>
                    <p class="mt-4 mb-4">
                    Your web browser can be set to allow you to control whether you will accept cookies, reject cookies, or to notify you each time a cookie is sent to your browser. If your browser is set to reject cookies, websites that are cookie-enabled will not recognize you when you return to the website, and some website functionality may be lost. The Help section of your browser may tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting cookies. To find out more about cookies, visit <a href="#"> www.aboutcookies.org.</a>
                    </p>
                    <p class="mt-4 mb-4">You can also control Flash cookies which we may use on certain Abbott websites and apps from time to time by clicking  <a href="#">here.</a> Why? Because Flash cookies cannot be controlled through your browser settings. Choices you make are both browser and device-specific.</p>
                    <p class="mt-4 mb-4">Here are some of the types of information collected when visiting Abbott Websites:</p>
                    <p class="mt-4 mb-4"><b>Log data:</b> When you use Abbott websites and apps, our servers automatically record information (“log data”), including information that your browser sends whenever you visit an website or app or your mobile app sends when you are using it. This log data may include your Internet Protocol address, the address of the webpages you visited that had Abbott features, browser type and settings, the date and time of your request, how you used websites and cookie data.</p>
                    <p class="mt-4 mb-4"><b>Cookie data</b> Depending on how you are accessing Abbott’s online Services, we and our Service Providers may use “cookies” (a small text file sent by your computer each time you visit our sites, unique to your Abbott account or your browser) or similar technologies, to record log data. When we use cookies, we may use “session” cookies (that last until you close your browser) or “persistent” cookies (that last until you and/or your browser delete them). For example, we may use cookies to remember your personal preferences, such as sections of the website that you visit frequently, your user ID, or other settings so you do not have to set them up every time you visit, and we may use cookies to serve you relevant advertising tailored to your interests. Some of the cookies we use are associated with your Abbott account (including personal information about you, such as the email address you gave us), and other cookies are not.</p>
                    <p class="mt-4 mb-4">
                    We may use Google Analytics, which uses cookies and similar technologies to collect and analyze information about use of the Abbott Services and report on activities and trends. This service may also collect information regarding the use of other websites, apps and online resources. You can learn about Google’s practices by going to  <a href="#">https://policies.google.com/privacy/google-partners,</a> and opt-out of them by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, available at <a href="#"> https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.</a>
                    </p>
                    <p class="mt-4 mb-4"><b>Social media plugins and data. </b> In addition, our websites and apps may use social media plugins (e.g., the Facebook "Like" button, '"Share to Twitter"' button) to enable you to easily share information with others. When you visit any of our online Abbott Services, the operator of the social plugin can place a cookie on your computer, enabling that operator to recognize individuals who have previously visited our websites. If you are logged into the social media website (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Google+) while browsing on our Abbott Services, the social plugins allow that social media website to receive information that you have visited our Abbott Services. The social plugins also allow the social media website to share information about your activities on Abbott with other users of their social media website. Abbott does not control any of the content from the social plugins. For more information about social plugins from other social media websites you should refer to those sites' privacy and data sharing statements.</p>
                    <p class="mt-4 mb-4">
                    If you choose to link your social media or Google account to Abbott, this allows us to obtain information from those accounts (such as your friends or contacts). The information we obtain from these services often depends on your settings or the applicable provider's privacy policies, so please check these policies before granting us access. You agree that we are not responsible for any acts or omissions by these social media service providers. If you give us permission to access this information, we will use it for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mt-4 mb-4"><b>Device information.</b> In addition to log data, we may also collect information about the device you are using to access our Abbott Services, including what type of device it is, what operating system you are using, device settings, unique device identifiers and crash data. Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you are using and its settings. For example, different types of information are available depending on whether you are using a Mac or a PC, or an iPhone or an Android phone. To learn more about what information your device may make available to us, please also check the policies of your device manufacturer or software provider.</p>
                    <p class="mt-4 mb-4"><b>Interest Based Advertising.</b> Abbott hopes to deliver to you advertising for products and services you need or want. Abbott, its vendors and partners, use common tracking tools, such as cookies, pixels, web beacons, and similar technologies, to automatically collect information about users for purposes of enhancing their online experience and delivering more meaningful advertisements. Like many companies, Abbott may also utilize third-party advertising vendors and other partners to collect this information.</p>
                    <p class="mt-4 mb-4">
                    Like most companies, we place advertisements where we think they will be most relevant to customers. One way we do so is by allowing network advertising companies with whom we work to place their own Tools when an individual visits Abbott websites and apps. This enables the network advertising company to recognize individuals who have previously visited Abbott websites and apps and to serve you ads based on your web browsing activity, purchases, interests and/or other information—a practice commonly referred to as interest-based advertising (“IBA”) or online behavioral advertising (“OBA”).
                    </p>
                    <p class="mt-4 mb-4">
                    These advertising companies may also use these types of technologies to recognize you across the devices you use, such as a mobile phone or a laptop, and serve you ads on websites you visit and applications you use.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mt-4 mb-4">
                        <b>Retargeting.</b>
                        One way in which we deliver more meaningful advertisements is through a common form of online advertising known as “retargeting” or “remarketing.” Retargeting works by serving ads on one site based on an individual’s online activities on a different, unrelated site. For example, if you look at Pediasure products on an Abbott website, you may later see an advertisement for Pediasure products when you visit third-party sites. To do this, Abbott or its advertising vendors may use a device ID, cookie, pixel, web beacon or similar technology placed by Abbott or our third-party vendor when you visit Abbott websites or apps or third-party websites or apps. The placing of these cookies or other technologies on your device may enable you to be identified across multiple websites. You should consult the privacy policies of our vendors and other websites that you visit to understand how they collect and use your data.
                    </p>

                        <b>Abbott Do Not Track Policy.</b>
                        Some browsers have Do Not Track (“DNT”) features that allow you to tell a website not to track you. These features are not all uniform, and some browsers may not be set up to honor such requests. Abbott honors the AdChoice DNT signals. Options you select are browser and device specific. Please be aware that limiting the ability of websites to set cookies, however, may worsen your overall user experience, and in some cases the sites will not work properly without cookies, local storage and similar technologies.
